agreed 20first 20ndc 20submission pdf reduce emission total 2005 aggregate number actually agreed cut total emission china agreed let grow smaller intensity measured total co2 emission percentage gdp hope implement something actually cut since produce nearly three time usa 2005 chart jpg expected future emission baseline agreement set make thing graded even huge drive last obama last year get agree projected slow co2 growth massively probably would flat lined 2030 anyway russia also pretty small pretty much expected flatline anyway think good fully ditching saying fuck noise espically
